# Results of the Doctoral Thesis
## *"Predicción estacional de sequía meteorológica y su aplicación en incendios forestales"*

In the following three chapters, corresponding to the outcomes of the doctoral thesis titled **"Seasonal Prediction of Meteorological Drought and its Application in Forest Fires,"** various resources are provided to the reader, contributing to the comprehension and analysis of the research. 

### Chapter 3: Prediction of Meteorological Drought in Spain
In this chapter, an empirical approach based on a hydrological model known as ESP (Smith, 1982; Day, 1985) is implemented to forecast meteorological droughts within the scope of Spain. The data, figures, and codes employed in this analysis are presented, supplied as supplementary material due to their volume and the constraints of incorporating them into the main body of the document. Refer to Torres-Vázquez et al., (2023).

### Chapter 4: Global Prediction of Meteorological Drought
Chapter 4 extends the application of the ESP method to make predictions of meteorological droughts on a global scale, utilizing eleven precipitation datasets from DROP (Turco et al., 2020). Additionally, a comparison is conducted with the advanced dynamic seasonal prediction model SEAS5, developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), as documented by Johnson et al. (2019).

### Chapter 5: Prediction of Anomaly in Fire-Affected Area
This chapter focuses on utilizing projections provided by SEAS5 in conjunction with the DROP datasets, with the aim of generating predictions regarding anomalies in areas affected by forest fires. This analysis follows the approach presented by Turco et al. (2018).

To access the precipitation data from the GPCP dataset, identified by the name "gpcp_cdr_v23rB1_1981_2021.nc," its substantial volume is noted, posing challenges in terms of loading within this application. Nevertheless, to gain access to this data, it is recommended to establish communication with the responsible author, whose contact details are available at the following web link: miguelangel.torres@um.es. Alternatively, the data can be acquired through the provided link: [https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.gpcp.html](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.gpcp.html).

In the case of the SEAS5-related data, they are available through the Copernicus Climate Data Store. To obtain this data, access can be gained through the following web link: [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset).

It is noteworthy that all codes have been organized using an alphanumeric sequence that enables their sequential reproduction. For instance, codes are labeled with letters followed by numbers, such as A1, A2, etc.
